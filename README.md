# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string value is assigned to a variable with a numeric type.  The error arises because TypeScript's type system enforces type safety, preventing incompatible assignments.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to assign a string to a variable that is explicitly typed as a number. TypeScript's compiler correctly flags this as an error, preventing runtime issues.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the TypeScript code using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
3. Observe the compiler error indicating the type mismatch.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all values assigned to numeric variables are, in fact, numbers. This may involve explicit type conversions, data validation, or changes to the code logic.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Please follow standard TypeScript coding practices and ensure that any modifications are thoroughly tested.
